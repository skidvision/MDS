# MDS

## Version 1.0, May 2020

Legacy multidimensional scaling package for Mathematica.

Copyright 1999-2020 Flip Phillips.

## Notes

Note that the `install.sh` in `_Attic` is idiosyncratic to my setup and likely will destroy things in your universe. To install, just drop this directory into your `FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]` and you should be good to go.

I'm not 100% this still even works well. The code is very much procedural and doesn't take advantage of anything new in the Wolfram Language since version 7 or 8.

At some point I will modernize it but, for now here it is.

## Examples

Example data is from an experiment Farley Norman and I did a long time ago?

```bibtex
@article{Norman:2004,
    Author = {Norman, J Farley and Norman, Hideko F and Clayton, Anna Marie and Lianekhammy, Joann and Zielke, Gina},
    Journal = {Percept Psychophys},
    Number = {2},
    Pages = {342--351},
    Title = {The visual and haptic perception of natural object shape.},
    Volume = {66},
    Year = {2004}}
```

Hey- why am I not cited in there?
